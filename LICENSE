The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The Licensor may make an Additional Use Grant, above, permitting limited production use.

Effective on the Change Date, or the fourth anniversary of the first publicly released version of the Licensed Work under this License, whichever is earlier for that version, the Licensor hereby grants you rights under the Change License for that version, and you may, at your option, continue to use the Licensed Work under the terms of this License or the Change License.

Any use of the Licensed Work in violation of this License will automatically terminate your rights under this License for the current and all other versions of the Licensed Work.

This License does not grant you any right in any trademark or logo of Licensor or its affiliates (provided that you may use a trademark or logo of Licensor as expressly required by this License).

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensed Work is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Licensed Work and assume any risks associated with your exercise of permissions under this License.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall the Licensor be liable to you for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Licensed Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.

This License sets forth the entire agreement between you and the Licensor relating to the Licensed Work. The Licensor may offer the Licensed Work under different license terms or stop distributing the Licensed Work at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.
